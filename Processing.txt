We use core jar file for Processing library

reference:https://processing.org/reference/

to create a PApplet we first extend PApplet class

the PApplet class has methods 
	setup(): run once for configuring the canvas 
	draw(): loops over as required to draw the content of canvas

we can use size() in setup to resize the canvas

we can load image into memory using loadImage() which returns a PImage

PImage can be resized using resize() in:
draw() to make its resize dynamic
setup() to make its resize static

PApplet class has a variable height and width which store the value of height and width of canvas(dynamic)
hence we can use PImageVar.resize(0,height) which means make image height = height of canvas and calculate width accordingly to keep ratio

we use diffrent shape methods in draw() to draw shapes on canvas

if we use fill() before drawing a shape in draw, then it draws the shape filled with the specified color in fill()
